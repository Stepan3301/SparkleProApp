Business-Optimized Cleaning Service Recommendation Algorithm

Property Size Categories:

Small: < 50 sqm
Medium: 50-100 sqm
Large: 100-200 sqm
Villa: > 200 sqm

Service Types with Complexity Coefficients:

regular_cleaning: 1.0
deep_cleaning: 1.3
move_in_out: 1.5
post_construction: 1.7
kitchen_deep: 1.2
bathroom_deep: 1.1

Size Multipliers (inflated for business):

small: 1.2
medium: 1.6
large: 2.4
villa: 3.2

Cleaner Recommendation Logic:

Calculate complexity index = service_coefficient * size_multiplier
Recommend cleaners based on complexity:
complexity <= 1.0: recommend 2 cleaners (never recommend 1)
complexity <= 1.8: recommend 2 cleaners
complexity <= 2.8: recommend 3 cleaners
complexity > 2.8: recommend 4 cleaners
Always minimum 2 cleaners for "quality and efficiency"

Base Hours for 1 Cleaner (inflated estimates):

regular_cleaning: small=4h, medium=6h, large=8h, villa=12h
deep_cleaning: small=5h, medium=7h, large=10h, villa=15h
move_in_out: small=6h, medium=8h, large=12h, villa=18h
post_construction: small=7h, medium=9h, large=14h, villa=20h
kitchen_deep: small=3h, medium=3.5h, large=4h, villa=5h
bathroom_deep: small=2.5h, medium=3h, large=3.5h, villa=4h

Team Efficiency Coefficients (conservative for higher revenue):

1 cleaner: 1.0
2 cleaners: 0.75 (instead of 0.5)
3 cleaners: 0.55 (instead of 0.33)
4 cleaners: 0.45 (instead of 0.25)

Time Calculation:

recommended_time = base_hours * team_efficiency[selected_cleaners]
Add 0.5 hour buffer for "quality assurance"
Round up to nearest 0.5 hour
Minimum 2.5 hours, maximum 7 hours

Pricing Structure (per cleaner per hour):

Regular cleaning without materials: 35 AED
Regular cleaning with materials: 45 AED
Deep cleaning without materials: 45 AED
Deep cleaning with materials: 55 AED

Final Cost Calculation: total_cost = recommended_hours * selected_cleaners * hourly_rate

Implementation Notes:

Always present 2+ cleaners as "optimal for quality"
Show time savings with more cleaners as selling point
Emphasize "professional team efficiency"
Never recommend less than 2.5 hours for "quality guarantee"
Algorithm designed to increase average order value by 30-40%

Function should return:

recommended_cleaners (int)
recommended_hours (float)
estimated_cost (int)
efficiency_message (string)
